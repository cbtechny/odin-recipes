Prepare the Turkey:

Remove giblets and neck from the turkey cavity.

Rinse the turkey inside and out under cold water; pat dry with paper towels.

Gently loosen the skin over the turkey breast without tearing.

Spread half of the herb butter under the skin.

Rub the remaining herb butter all over the outside of the turkey.

Fill the cavity with onion quarters, chopped celery, and carrots.

Tie the legs together with kitchen twine.

Roast the Turkey:

Place the turkey on a roasting rack in a large roasting pan.

Pour chicken broth into the bottom of the pan.

Roast for approximately 15 minutes per pound, or until a meat thermometer reads 165°F (74°C) in the thickest part of the thigh.

Baste every 45 minutes with pan juices.
